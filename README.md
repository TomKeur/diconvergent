== (Di|Con)vergent Mob Refactoring ==

=== Before we the workshop ===
Please clone this project and run the tests. If you have any issues, do not hesitate to contact us.

=== When the workshop begins ===
One of the goals of this workshop is to test your "attitude". Please think about and answer these following questions
to get a basic understanding. It doesn't have to be perfect and shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes.
Please note that "tend to" does not mean one or the other exclusively. Just go with the first choice that comes up for
you.

* When someone shares an idea with me, I tend to
 - See potential problems and risks
 - Get ideas of my own
* At the start of a new project, I tend to
 - Think big and work out the general picture
 - Work out some details and start coding to get a better understanding
* Etc.
 - Uhuh
 - Yes

=== During the workshop ===
We will divide you up into teams of four and hand out your assignments. While it's ok with us if you decide to do
diverge from our suggestion, we suggest to work on the problems in four rounds of ten minutes. Each round one of you
codes, or "drives", while the others assist, or "navigate".

During the first hour, the goal is to diverge and explore. The script for drivers is as follows:

- You talk out loud about your ideas
- Code, code, code; do not be afraid to type and remove
- Don't dive in too much; focus on call-callee interaction and how it *feels*

The script for navigators is as follows:

- Hush; do not interrupt or distract the driver
- Share ideas between navigators using the provided post-its
- You may only interrupt the driver by softly saying "emergency break!"

During the second hour, the goal is to converge and choose. The script for drivers is as follows:

- Talk
- Code

The script for navigators is as follows:

- Talk

Good luck!
